# Edimax

__Edimax SP-2101W__ is a smart plug to turn an electrical device connected to it on and off under wifi control, 
and to measure its power consumption where data values are transmitted by wifi. 
The plug can be controlled in a limited way by means of smartphone apps (__EdiSmart__, __EdiSmart__). 
Greater applicability, however, can be obtained by means of a self-made and taylored PC application.

The application __edimax__ has the following features:

* measure the power consumption of electrical devices as a function of time
* display and plot the measured data as power (W), current (A) or energy (Wh). The energy consumption over time is calculated by integration of the measured power curve.
* store the measured data in a csv file
* load previously measured curves and overlay them for comparison in a plot
