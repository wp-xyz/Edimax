__EdiMax SP2101W__ is a smart plug to turn on and off electric device connected to it under wifi control, 
and to measure their power consumption (data results are transmitted by wifi). 
The plug can be controlled in a limited way by means of smartphone apps (__EdiSmart__, __EdiSmart__). 
Greater applicability, however, can be obtained by means of a self-made and taylored PC application.

The application __edimax__ has the following features:

* measure the power consumption of electric devices as a function of time
* display the measured data as power (W), current (A) or energy (Wh)
* store the measured curve in a csv file
* load previously measured curves and overlay them for comparison
