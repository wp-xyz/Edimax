                              SETTING UP OF THE PLUG
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Install the EdiPlug app on your Android smartphone. Problem: the app is not
  found in the PlayStore any more - search for a third-party download site,
  e.g. https://apkgk.com/en/com.edimax.smartplugin (works at the time of this
  writing). You must enable installation from unknown sources for this.
* Connect the plug to power, wait until the bottom red LED is flashing once
  per second
* Go to the wifi settings of your smartphone and connect to the SSID 
  "Ediplug.Setup". Note this is an open net, no password required.
* Open EdiPlug app
* Select "+" to add the new plug
* Select your normal wifi net from the displayed list of available wifi nets, 
  enter your wifi password.
* The plug connects to your normal wifi net and shuts down the "Ediplug.Setup"
  net.
* Reconnect your smartphone to your normal wifi net (if not done automatically).
* If you want to change the username and password for access you can do this
  in the smartphone app.
* Note: the default username is "admin" and the default password is "1234".

  change anything. Otherwise enter the correct values. Close "setup".
